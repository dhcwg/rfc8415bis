    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
      IPv6 (DHCPv6): an extensible mechanism for configuring nodes with
      network configuration parameters, IP addresses, and prefixes. Parameters
      can be provided statelessly, or in combination with stateful assignment
      of one or more IPv6 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes. DHCPv6 can operate
      either in place of or in addition to stateless address autoconfiguration
      (SLAAC).</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes RFC8415 to incorporate reported errata and to
      obsolete the assignment of temporary addresses (the IA_TA option) and the
      server unicast capability (the Server Unicast option and UseMulticast
      status code).</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document specifies DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6), a client/server
      protocol that provides managed configuration of devices. The basic
      operation of DHCPv6 provides configuration for clients connected to
      the same link as the server. Relay agent functionality is also
      defined for enabling communication between clients and servers that
      are not on the same link.</t>
      <t>DHCPv6 can provide a device with addresses assigned by a DHCPv6
      server and other configuration information; this data is carried in
      options. DHCPv6 can be extended through the definition of new options
      to carry configuration information not specified in this document.</t>
      <t>DHCPv6 also supports a mechanism for automated delegation of
      IPv6 prefixes. Through this mechanism, a server
      can delegate prefixes to clients. Use of this mechanism is
      specified as part of <xref target="RFC7084" format="default"/> and by <xref target="TR-187" format="default"/>.
      Note that these documents use "requesting router" for what this
      document uses client and "delegating router" for server.</t>
      <t>DHCP can also be used just to provide other configuration options
      (i.e., no addresses or prefixes). That implies that the
      server does not have to track any state; thus, this mode is called
      "stateless DHCPv6". Mechanisms necessary to support stateless DHCPv6 are
      much simpler than mechanisms needed to support stateful DHCPv6.</t>
      <section anchor="previous-dhcp6" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Relationship to Previous DHCPv6 Standards</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/> provided a unified, corrected, and cleaned-up
        definition of DHCPv6 that also covered all applicable errata filed
        against older RFCs. It also obsoleted a small number of mechanisms:
        delayed authentication, lifetime and timer hints sent by a client.</t>
        <t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/> by applying all
        applicable errata and obsoleting two features that have not
        been widely implemented - the assignment of temporary addresses
        using the IA_TA option and allowing clients to unicast some messages
        directly to the server if the server sent the Server Unicast option
        to a client in an early exchange. It also clarifies the UDP ports used
        by clients, servers, and relay agents (<xref target="udp-ports" format="default"/>).
        See <xref target="ChangeSummary" format="default"/> for a list of differences
        from <xref target="RFC8415" format="default"/>.</t>

        <name>Topics Out of Scope</name>
        <t>This document specifies the DHCPv6 protocol behavior. The server policy, such as
        what options to assign to which clients, which subnets or pools of resources to use,
        which clients' requests should be denied etc. are out of scope for this document.</t>
        <t>Server configuration, operation and management are also out of scope. An
        approach to manage DHCPv6 relays and servers is specified in <xref target="RFC9243" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Merging DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131" format="default"/> and DHCPv6 configuration is out of scope for
        this document. <xref target="RFC4477" format="default"/> discusses some issues
        and possible strategies for running DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 services
        together. While <xref target="RFC4477" format="default"/> is a bit dated, it provides
        a good overview of the issues at hand.
        The current consensus of the IETF is that DHCPv4 should be used rather
        than DHCPv6 when conveying IPv4 configuration information to nodes.
        For IPv6-only networks, <xref target="RFC7341" format="default"/> describes a
        transport mechanism to carry DHCPv4 messages using the DHCPv6 protocol
        for the dynamic provisioning of IPv4 address and configuration
        information.</t>

            A client may have more than one IA assigned to it -- for example,
            one for each of its interfaces. Each IA holds one type of
            lease; for example, an identity association for non-temporary
            addresses (IA_NA) holds addresses, and an identity
            association for prefix delegation (IA_PD) holds delegated
            prefixes. Throughout this document, "IA" is used to refer to
            an identity association without identifying the type
            of a lease in the IA. This document defines three IA types:
            IA_NA, IA_TA (obsoleted), and IA_PD. Another IA type (IA_LL) was

          <dt>IAID</dt>
          <dd>Identity Association Identifier: an identifier

            belong to that client.</dd>
          <dt>IA_NA</dt>
          <dd>Identity Association for Non‑temporary

          <dt>IA_PD</dt>
          <dd>Identity Association for Prefix Delegation: an
            IA that carries delegated prefixes.
            See <xref target="IA_PD-option" format="default"/> for details on the

      <name>Client/Server Exchanges</name>
      <t>Clients and servers exchange DHCP messages using UDP
     (see <xref target="RFC0768" format="default"/> and <xref target="BCP145" format="default"/>).
     The client uses a link-local source address or
     addresses determined through other mechanisms for transmitting and
     receiving DHCP messages.</t>
      <t>A DHCP client sends all messages using a reserved, link-scoped
     multicast destination address (All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers - ff02::1:2) so that the client need not be
     configured with the address or addresses of DHCP servers.</t>
      <t>To allow a DHCP client to send a message to a DHCP server that is
     not attached to the same link, a DHCP relay agent on the client's link
     will relay messages between the client and server. The operation of
     the relay agent is transparent to the client. The discussion of
     message exchanges in the remainder of this section will omit the
     description of the relaying of messages by relay agents.</t>
      <section anchor="RFC3315-1.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Client/Server Exchanges Involving Two Messages</name>
        <t>When a DHCP client does not need to have a DHCP server assign
        IP addresses or delegated prefixes to it, the client can obtain other
        configuration information such as a
        list of available DNS servers <xref target="RFC3646" format="default"/> or
        NTP servers <xref target="RFC5908" format="default"/> through a single message and
        reply exchange with a DHCP server. To obtain other configuration
        information, the client first sends an Information-request message to
        the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address. Servers
        respond with a Reply message containing the other configuration
        information for the client.</t>
        <t>A client may also request the server to expedite address assignment
        and/or prefix delegation by using a two-message
        exchange instead of the normal four-message exchange as discussed
        in the next section. Expedited assignment can be requested by the
        client, and servers may or may not honor the request (see
        Sections <xref target="RFC3315-17.2.1" format="counter"/>
        and <xref target="RFC3315-22.14" format="counter"/>
        for more details and why servers may not honor this request).
        Clients may request this expedited service in environments where it
        is likely that there is only one server available on a link and no
        expectation that a second server would become available, or when
        completing the configuration process as quickly as possible is a
        priority.</t>
        <t>To request the expedited two-message exchange, the client
        sends a Solicit message to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address
        requesting the assignment of addresses and/or delegated prefixes and other configuration
        information. This message includes an indication (the Rapid Commit
        option; see <xref target="RFC3315-22.14" format="default"/>) that the client is
        willing to accept an immediate Reply message from the server. The
        server that is willing to commit the assignment of addresses and/or
        delegated prefixes to the client immediately responds with a Reply
        message. The configuration information and the addresses and/or
        delegated prefixes in the Reply message are then
        immediately available for use by the client.</t>
        <t>Each address or delegated prefix assigned to the client has associated preferred and
        valid lifetimes specified by the server. To request an extension of
        the lifetimes assigned to an address or delegated prefix, the client sends a Renew message
        to the server. The server sends a Reply message to the client with the
        new lifetimes, allowing the client to continue to use the address or
        delegated prefix without interruption. If the server is unable to extend
        the lifetime of an address or delegated prefix, it indicates this by
        returning the address or delegated prefix with lifetimes of 0. At the same
        time, the server may assign other addresses or delegated prefixes.</t>

        <t>To request the assignment of one or more addresses and/or delegated prefixes, a client
        first locates a DHCP server and then requests the assignment of
        addresses and/or delegated prefixes and other configuration information from the server. The
        client sends a Solicit message to the
        All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address to find available DHCP
        servers. Any server that can meet the client's requirements responds
        with an Advertise message. The client then chooses one of the servers
        and sends a Request message to the server asking for confirmed
        assignment of addresses and/or delegated prefixes and other configuration information. The
        server responds with a Reply message that contains the confirmed
        addresses, delegated prefixes, and configuration.</t>

      <name>Operational Models</name>
      <t>This section describes some of the current most common DHCP
      operational models. The described models are not mutually exclusive and
      are sometimes used together. For example, a device may start in stateful
      mode to obtain an address and, at a later time when an application is
      started, request additional parameters using stateless mode.</t>
      <t>This document assumes that the DHCP servers and the client,
      communicating with the servers via a specific interface, belong to a
      single provisioning domain.</t>
      <t>DHCP may be extended to support additional stateful services that
      may interact with one or more of the models described below. Such
      interaction should be considered and documented as part of any future
      protocol extension.</t>
      <section anchor="OpModes-Stateless" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Stateless DHCP</name>
        <t>Stateless DHCP can be
        used at any time, typically when a node requires
        some missing or expired configuration information that is available
        via DHCP.
        </t>
        <t>This is the simplest and most basic operation for DHCP and requires
        a client (and a server) to support only two messages --
        Information‑request and Reply. Note that DHCP servers and
        relay agents typically also need to support the Relay-forward and
        Relay‑reply messages to accommodate operation when clients and
        servers are not on the same link.</t>

      <section anchor="OpModes-NA" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>DHCP for Non-temporary Address Assignment</name>
        <t>This model of operation was the original motivation for DHCP.
        It is appropriate for situations where
        stateless address autoconfiguration alone is insufficient or
        impractical, e.g., because of network policy, additional requirements
        such as dynamic updates to the DNS, or client-specific requirements.</t>
        <t>The model of operation for non-temporary address assignment is as
        follows:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The server is provided with prefixes from which it may
        assign addresses to clients, as well as any related network topology
        information as to which prefixes are present on which links.
        </li>
        <li>A client requests a non-temporary address to be assigned by the server. The
        server allocates an address or addresses appropriate for the link on
        which the client is connected.
        </li>
        <li>The server returns the allocated address or addresses to the client.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Each address has associated preferred and valid lifetimes (see <xref target="RFC3315-10.1" format="default" />), which
        constitute an agreement about the length of time over which the
        client is allowed to use the address. A client can request an
        extension of the lifetimes on an address and is required to terminate
        the use of an address if the valid lifetime of the address
        expires.</t>
        <t>Typically, clients request other configuration parameters, such as
        the DNS name server addresses and domain search lists, when requesting
        addresses.</t>
        <t>Clients can also request more than one address or set of addresses
        (see Sections <xref target="multiple-addrs" format="counter"/>

        <name>DHCP for Prefix Delegation</name>
        <t>The prefix delegation mechanism is another stateful mode of operation and
        was originally intended for simple delegation of prefixes from a
        DHCP server to DHCP clients (typically routers).
        It is appropriate for situations in which the client
        (1) does not have knowledge about the topology of the
        networks to which it is attached and
        (2) does not require other information to choose a prefix for delegation.
        This mechanism is appropriate for use by an ISP to
        delegate a prefix to a subscriber, where the delegated prefix would
        possibly be subnetted and assigned to the links within the
        subscriber's network. <xref target="RFC7084" format="default"/> and
        <xref target="RFC7368" format="default"/> describe such use in detail.</t>
        <t>The design of this prefix delegation mechanism meets the requirements
        for prefix delegation in <xref target="RFC3769" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>DHCP prefix delegation itself does not require that the client forward
        IP packets not addressed to itself and thus does not require
        that the client (or server) be a router as defined in
        <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>. Also, in many cases (such as tethering
        or hosting virtual machines), hosts are already forwarding IP
        packets and thus are operating as routers as defined in
        <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The model of operation for prefix delegation is as follows:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The
        server is provisioned with prefixes to be delegated to
        clients.
        </li>
        <li>A client requests prefix(es) from the
        server, as described in <xref target="configuration-exchange" format="default"/>.
        </li>
        <li>The server chooses
        prefix(es) for delegation and responds with prefix(es) to the
        client.
        </li>
        <li>The client is then responsible for the
        delegated prefix(es). For example, the client might assign
        a subnet from a delegated prefix to one of its interfaces and begin
        sending Router Advertisements for the prefix on that link.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Each prefix has an associated preferred lifetime and
        valid lifetime (see <xref target="RFC3315-10.2" format="default" />), which constitute an agreement about the length of time
        over which the client is allowed to use the prefix. A client
        can request an extension of the lifetimes on a delegated prefix and is
        required to terminate the use of a delegated prefix if the valid
        lifetime of the prefix expires.</t>

        <t>In this example, the server (in the ISP core network or integrated
        in the aggregation device) is configured with a set of
        prefixes to be used for assignment to customers at the time of each
        customer's first connection to the ISP service. The prefix delegation
        process begins when the client (CPE) requests configuration
        information through DHCP. The DHCP messages from the client
        are received by the server via the aggregation device. When
        the server receives the request, it selects an available
        prefix or prefixes for delegation to the client. The
        server then returns the prefix or prefixes to the
        client.</t>
        <t>The client subnets the delegated prefix and assigns the
        longer prefixes to links in the subscriber's network. In a typical
        scenario based on the network shown in <xref target="FigISPNetwork" format="default"/>, the client subnets a single
        delegated /48 prefix into /64 prefixes and assigns one /64 prefix to
        each of the links in the subscriber network.</t>
        <t>The prefix delegation options can be used in conjunction with other
        DHCP options carrying other configuration information to the
        client. The client may, in turn, provide DHCP
        service to nodes attached to the internal network. For example, the
        client may obtain the addresses of DNS and NTP servers from
        the ISP server and then pass that configuration
        information on to the subscriber hosts through a DHCP server in the
        client.</t>
        <t>If the client uses a delegated prefix to configure addresses on
       interfaces on itself or other nodes behind it, the preferred and
       valid lifetimes of those addresses MUST be no longer than the
       remaining preferred and valid lifetimes, respectively, for the
       delegated prefix at any time. In particular, if the delegated
       prefix or a prefix derived from it is advertised for stateless
       address autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>, the advertised
       preferred and valid lifetimes MUST NOT exceed the corresponding
       remaining lifetimes of the delegated prefix.</t>
       <t>
         A client that has delegated any of the address space received through
         DHCP Prefix Delegation MUST NOT issue a DHCP Release on the relevant
         delegated prefix while any of the address space is outstanding.
         That includes addresses leased out by DHCPv6 (IA_NA), prefixes delegated
         via DHCPv6-PD (IA_PD), and addresses autoconfigured by IPv6 Router
         Advertisements.
         Requirement WPD-9 in <xref target="RFC9096" format="default" /> makes this
         the Best Current Practice.

       <t>
         <xref target="RFC9096" format="default" /> section 3.3 further

      <section anchor="multiple-addrs" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Multiple Addresses and Prefixes</name>
        <t>DHCP allows a client to receive multiple addresses.
        During typical operation, a client sends one instance
        of an IA_NA option and the server assigns at most one address from
        each prefix assigned to the link to which the client is attached.
        In
        particular, the server can be configured to serve addresses out
        of multiple prefixes for a given link. This is useful in cases
        such as when a network renumbering event is in progress. In a typical
        deployment, the server will grant one address for each IA_NA
        option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.4" format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>To meet the recommendations of <xref target="RFC7934" format="default" />,
        a client can explicitly request multiple addresses by sending
        multiple IA_NA options. A client can send multiple
        IA_NA options in its initial transmissions.
        Alternatively, it can send an extra Request message
        with additional new IA_NA options (or include them
        in a Renew message).</t>
        <t>The same principle also applies to prefix delegation. In
        principle, DHCP allows a client to request new prefixes
        to be delegated by sending additional IA_PD options
        (see <xref target="IA_PD-option" format="default"/>). However, a
        typical operator usually prefers to delegate a single, larger
        prefix. In most deployments, it is recommended that the client
        request a larger prefix in its initial transmissions rather than
        request additional prefixes later on.</t>
        <t>The exact behavior of the server (whether to grant additional
        addresses and prefixes or not) is up to the server policy and is
        out of scope for this document.</t>

        <name>Registering Self-generated Addresses</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC9686" format="default"/> introduces a method for
        devices to register their self-generated or statically configured addresses
        in the DHCPv6 servers. The general idea is that devices would notify the
        server about addresses that they are using, so that the server can log
        or record these addresses as required by local policy.</t>

        <t>The major specificity of this mechanism is that the address
        selection is not done by the DHCP server, but by the device itself. The most
        of the lifecycle remains the same in principle: a lease is created by the server,
        and the device performs periodic actions to get the lease renewed, and eventually
        the lease can expire. However, this mechanism uses different message types
        (ADDR-REG-INFORM and ADDR-REG-REPLY) and has different source address requirements,
        as defined in <xref target="RFC9686" format="default"/>.</t>

      <name>DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID)</name>
      <t>Each DHCP client and server has a DUID. DHCP servers use DUIDs to
      identify clients for the selection of configuration parameters and in
      the association of IAs with clients. DHCP clients use DUIDs to identify
      a server in messages where a server needs to be identified. See
      Sections <xref target="RFC3315-22.2" format="counter"/> and
      <xref target="RFC3315-22.3" format="counter"/>
      for details regarding the representation of a DUID in a DHCP message.</t>
      <t>Clients and servers MUST treat DUIDs as opaque values and MUST only
      compare DUIDs for equality. Clients and servers SHOULD NOT in any other
      way interpret DUIDs. Clients and servers MUST NOT restrict DUIDs to the
      types defined in this document, as additional DUID types may be defined
      in the future. It should be noted that an attempt to parse a DUID to
      obtain a client's link-layer address is unreliable, as there is no
      guarantee that the client is still using the same link‑layer
      address as when it generated its DUID. Also, such an attempt will be
      more and more unreliable as more clients adopt privacy measures
      such as those defined in <xref target="RFC7844" format="default"/>.
      If this capability is required, it is recommended to rely on the
      Client Link‑Layer Address option instead
      <xref target="RFC6939" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The DUID is carried in an option because it may be variable in length
      and because it is not required in all DHCP messages. The DUID is
      designed to be unique across all DHCP clients and servers, and stable
      for any specific client or server.  That is, the DUID used by a
      client or server SHOULD NOT change over time if at all possible; for
      example, a device's DUID should not change as a result of a change in
      the device's network hardware or changes to virtual interfaces (e.g.,
      logical PPP (over Ethernet) interfaces that may come and go in
      Customer Premises Equipment routers). The client
      may change its DUID as specified in <xref target="RFC7844" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The motivation for having more than one type of DUID is that the DUID
      must be globally unique and must also be easy to generate. The sort of
      globally unique identifier that is easy to generate for any given device
      can differ quite widely. Also, some devices may not contain any
      persistent storage. Retaining a generated DUID in such a device is not
      possible, so the DUID scheme must accommodate such devices.</t>

        <t>A DUID consists of a 2-octet type code represented in network

        <name>DUID Based on Link-Layer Address Plus Time (DUID-LLT)</name>
        <t>This type of DUID consists of a 2-octet type field containing the
        value 1, a 2-octet hardware type code, and 4 octets containing
        a time value, followed by the link-layer address of any one network
        interface that is connected to the DHCP device at the time that the
        DUID is generated. The time value is the time that the DUID is
        generated, represented in seconds since midnight (UTC), January 1,
        2000, modulo 2^32. The hardware type MUST be a valid hardware type
        assigned by IANA; see <xref target="IANA-HARDWARE-TYPES" format="default"/>. Both the
        time and the hardware type are stored in network byte order. For
        Ethernet hardware types, the link-layer address is stored in canonical

        <t>The choice of network interface can be completely arbitrary, as
        long as that interface provides a globally unique link-layer address
        for the link type; the same DUID-LLT SHOULD be used in configuring
        all network interfaces connected to the device, regardless of which
        interface's link-layer address was used to generate the DUID-LLT.</t>
        <t>Clients and servers using this type of DUID MUST store the DUID-LLT
        in stable storage and MUST continue to use this DUID-LLT even if the
        network interface used to generate the DUID-LLT is removed. Clients
        and servers that do not have any stable storage MUST NOT use this type
        of DUID.</t>
        <t>Clients and servers that use this DUID SHOULD attempt to configure
        the time prior to generating the DUID, if that is possible, and MUST
        use some sort of time source (for example, a real-time clock) in
        generating the DUID, even if that time source could not be configured
        prior to generating the DUID. The use of a time source makes it
        unlikely that two identical DUID-LLTs will be generated if the network
        interface is removed from the client and another client then uses the
        same network interface to generate a DUID-LLT. A collision between two
        DUID-LLTs is very unlikely even if the clocks have not been configured
        prior to generating the DUID.</t>
        <t>This method of DUID generation is recommended for all
        general-purpose computing devices such as desktop computers and laptop
        computers, and also for devices such as printers, routers, and so on,
        that contain some form of writable non-volatile storage.</t>
        <t>It is possible that this algorithm for
        generating a DUID could result in a client identifier collision. A
        DHCP client that generates a DUID-LLT using this mechanism MUST
        provide an administrative interface that replaces the existing DUID
        with a newly generated DUID-LLT.</t>

        <t>The source of the identifier is left up to the vendor defining it,
        but each identifier part of each DUID-EN MUST be unique to the device
        that is using it, and MUST be assigned to the device no later than at
        the first usage and stored in some form of non-volatile storage. This
        typically means being assigned during the manufacturing process
        in the case of physical devices or, in the case of virtual machines,
        when the image is created or booted for the first time. The

      <name>Identity Association</name>
      <t>An Identity Association (IA) is a construct through which a server
      and a client can identify, group, and manage a set of related IPv6
      addresses or delegated prefixes. Each IA consists of an IAID and
      associated configuration information.</t>
      <t>The IAID uniquely identifies the IA and MUST be chosen to be unique
      among the IAIDs for that IA type on the client (e.g., an IA_NA with
      an IAID of 0 and an IA_PD with an IAID of 0 are each considered unique).
      The IAID is chosen by the client. For any given use of an IA by the
      client, the IAID for that IA MUST be consistent across restarts of the
      DHCP client. The client may maintain consistency by either storing the
      IAID in non-volatile storage or using an algorithm that will
      consistently produce the same IAID as long as the configuration of the
      client has not changed. There may be no way for a client to maintain
      consistency of the IAIDs if it does not have non-volatile storage and
      the client's hardware configuration changes. If the client uses only one
      IAID, it can use a well-known value, e.g., zero.</t>
      <t>If the client wishes to obtain a distinctly new address or prefix and
      deprecate the existing one, the client sends a Release message
      to the server for the IAs using the original IAID. The client then
      creates a new IAID, to be used in future messages to obtain leases for
      the new IA.</t>

        addresses from a DHCP server. The client uses the IAs assigned to an
        interface to obtain configuration information from a server for that
        interface. Each such IA must be associated with exactly one interface.</t>
        <t>The configuration information in an IA_NA option consists of one or
        more IPv6 addresses along with the T1 and T2 values for the IA. See <xref target="RFC3315-22.4" format="default"/> for details regarding the representation of an IA_NA in a

        delegated prefixes must create at

        <name>Rate Limiting</name>
        <t>
          A DHCPv6 client MUST limit the rate of DHCP messages it
          transmits or retransmits.
          This will minimise the impact of prolonged message bursts or loops,
          for example when a client rejects a server's response, repeats the
          request and gets the same server response which again gets rejected
          by the client.
          </t>

          <t> This loop can repeat infinitely if
        there is not a quit/stop mechanism. Therefore, a client must not
        initiate transmissions too frequently.
      </t>
        <t>A recommended method for implementing the rate-limiting function is
        a token bucket (see Appendix A of <xref target="RFC3290" format="default"/>), limiting the average rate of transmission to a certain
        number in a certain time interval. This method of bounding burstiness also
        guarantees that the long-term transmission rate will not be exceeded.</t>
        <t>A transmission rate limit SHOULD be configurable. A possible
        default could be 20 messages in 20 seconds.</t>
        <t>For a device that has multiple interfaces, the limit MUST be
        enforced on a per-interface basis.</t>

      <name>Reliability of Client-Initiated Message Exchanges</name>
      <t>DHCP clients are responsible for reliable delivery of messages in the
      client-initiated message exchanges described in <xref target="configuration-exchange" format="default"/>. If a DHCP client fails to
      receive an expected response from a server, the client must retransmit
      its message according to the retransmission strategy described below.</t>

      <t>Note that the procedure described in this section is slightly
      modified when used with the Solicit message. The modified procedure is
      described in <xref target="solicit-create-transmit" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The client begins the message exchange by transmitting a message to
      the server. The message exchange terminates when either
      (1) the client successfully receives the appropriate response or
      responses from a server or servers or (2) the message exchange is
      considered to have failed according to the retransmission mechanism
      described below.</t>
      <t>The client MUST update an "elapsed-time" value within an Elapsed
      Time option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.9" format="default"/>) in the
      retransmitted message. In some cases, the client may also need to modify
      values in IA Address options (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.6" format="default"/>) or
      IA Prefix options (see <xref target="IAPREFIX-option" format="default"/>) if a valid lifetime for
      any of the client's leases expires before retransmission. Thus, whenever
      this document refers to a "retransmission" of a client's message, it
      refers to both modifying the original message and sending this new message
      instance to the server.</t>
      <t>The client retransmission behavior is controlled and described by the

      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="11">

      The algorithm for RAND is common across all message transmissions.</t>
      <t>With each message transmission or retransmission, the client sets RT
      according to the rules given below. If RT expires before the message
      exchange terminates, the client recomputes RT and retransmits the
      message.</t>
      <t>Each of the computations of a new RT includes a randomization factor
      (RAND), which is a random number chosen with a uniform distribution
      between -0.1 and +0.1. The randomization factor is included to minimize
      synchronization of messages transmitted by DHCP clients.</t>
      <t>The algorithm for choosing a random number does not need to be
      cryptographically sound. The algorithm SHOULD produce a different
      sequence of random numbers from each invocation of the DHCP client.</t>
      <t>RT for the first message transmission is based on IRT:</t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
   RT = IRT + RAND*IRT

      value of RT:</t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
   RT = 2*RTprev + RAND*RTprev
      ]]></artwork>
      <t>MRT specifies an upper bound on the value of RT (disregarding the
      randomization added by the use of RAND). If MRT has a value of 0, there
      is no upper limit on the value of RT. Otherwise:</t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[

      <t>MRC specifies an upper bound on the number of times a client may
      retransmit a message. Unless MRC is zero, the message exchange fails
      once the client has transmitted the message MRC times.</t>
      <t>MRD specifies an upper bound on the length of time a client may
      retransmit a message. Unless MRD is zero, the message exchange fails
      once MRD seconds have elapsed since the client first transmitted the
      message.</t>
      <t>If both MRC and MRD are non-zero, the message exchange fails whenever
      either of the conditions specified in the previous two paragraphs
      is met.</t>
      <t>If both MRC and MRD are zero, the client continues to transmit the
      message until it receives a response.</t>
      <t>A client is not expected to listen for a response during the entire
      RT period and may turn off listening capabilities after waiting at least
      the shorter of RT and MAX_WAIT_TIME due to power consumption saving or

      <t>If a server receives a message that it considers invalid, it
      MAY send a Reply message (or Advertise message, as appropriate) with a

      Identifier option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.2" format="default"/>) (if one was

      <t>Clients, relay agents, and servers MUST NOT discard messages that
      contain unknown options (or instances of vendor options with unknown
      enterprise-number values). These options should be ignored as if they were not
      present.  This is critical to provide for future extensions of DHCP.</t>
      <t>A client or server MUST discard any received DHCP messages

      Clients SHOULD NOT accept multicast messages.

      <t>
      Servers SHOULD NOT accept unicast traffic from clients.
      The Server Unicast option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.12" format="default"/>)
      and UseMulticast status code (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.13" format="default"/>)
      have been obsoleted and hence clients should no longer send messages
      to a server's unicast address nor receive the UseMulticast status code.
      However, a server that previously supported the Server Unicast option
      and is upgraded to not support it, MAY continue to receive
      unicast messages if it previously sent the client the Server Unicast
      option. But this causes no harm and the client will eventually switch
      back to sending multicast messages (such as after the lease's rebinding time
      is reached or the client is rebooted).

        <name>Use of Transaction IDs</name>
        <t>The "transaction-id" field holds a value used by clients and

        Note that if a client generates easily predictable transaction

      <name>DHCP Configuration Exchanges</name>
      <t>A client initiates a message exchange with a server or servers to
      acquire or update configuration information of interest. A client has
      many reasons to initiate the configuration exchange. Some of the
      more common ones are:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>as part of the operating system configuration/bootstrap process,</li>
        <li>when requested to do so by the application layer
        (through an operating-system-specific API),</li>
        <li>when a Router Advertisement indicates that DHCPv6 is available for
        address configuration (see Section 4.2 of
        <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/>),</li>
        <li>as required to extend the lifetime of address(es) and/or
        delegated prefix(es), using Renew and Rebind messages, or</li>
        <li>upon the receipt of a Reconfigure message, when requested to do so
        by a server.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The client is responsible for creating IAs and requesting that a
      server assign addresses and/or delegated prefixes to the IAs. The
      client first creates the IAs and assigns IAIDs to them. The client then
      transmits a Solicit message containing the IA options describing the
      IAs. The client MUST NOT be using any of the addresses or delegated
      prefixes for which it tries to obtain the bindings by sending the
      Solicit message. In particular, if the client had some valid bindings
      and has chosen to start the server discovery process to obtain the
      same bindings from a different server, the client MUST stop using the
      addresses and delegated prefixes for the bindings that it had obtained
      from the previous server (see <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.6" format="default"/> for
      more details on what "stop using" means in this context) and that it is
      now trying to obtain from a new server.</t>
      <t>A DHCP client that does not need to have a DHCP server assign
      IP addresses or delegated prefixes to it can obtain configuration
      information such as a list of available DNS servers <xref target="RFC3646" format="default"/> or NTP servers <xref target="RFC5908" format="default"/> through a
      single message and reply exchange with a DHCP server.
      To obtain
      configuration information, the client first sends an Information-request
      message (see <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.5" format="default"/>) to the
      All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  Servers respond
      with a Reply message containing the configuration information for the
      client (see <xref target="RFC3315-18.2.5" format="default"/>).</t>
      <t>To request the assignment of one or more addresses or delegated
      prefixes, a client first locates a DHCP server and then requests the
      assignment of addresses/prefixes and other configuration information from the
      server. The client does this by sending the Solicit message
      (see <xref target="solicit-create-transmit" format="default"/>) to the
      All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address and collecting
      Advertise messages from the servers that respond to the client's
      message; the client then selects a server from which it wants to obtain
      configuration information. This process is referred to as server
      discovery. When the client has selected the server, it sends a Request
      message to that server as described in <xref target="request-create-transmit" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>A client willing to perform the Solicit/Reply message
      exchange described in <xref target="solicit-create-transmit" format="default"/> includes a Rapid
      Commit option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.14" format="default"/>) in its
      Solicit message.</t>
      <t>Servers that can assign addresses or delegated prefixes to the IAs
      respond to the client with an Advertise message or Reply message if the
      client included a Rapid Commit option and the server is configured to
      accept it.</t>
      <t>If the server responds with an Advertise message, the client initiates
      a configuration exchange as described in
      <xref target="request-create-transmit" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>A server may initiate a message exchange with a client by sending a
      Reconfigure message to cause the client to send a Renew, Rebind, or
      Information-request message to refresh its configuration information as
      soon as the Reconfigure message is received by the client.</t>
      <t><xref target="FigMsgFlow" format="default"/> shows a timeline diagram of the
      messages exchanged between a client and two servers for the
      typical lifecycle of one or more leases. This starts with the

        <name>A Single Exchange for Multiple IA Options</name>
        <t>This document assumes that a client SHOULD use a single transaction
      for all of the IA options required on an interface; this simplifies
      the client implementation and reduces the potential number of
      transactions required. To facilitate
      a client's use of a single transaction for all IA options, servers
      MUST return the same T1/T2 values for all IA options in a Reply
      (see Sections <xref target="RFC3315-18.2.1" format="counter"/>,
      <xref target="RFC3315-18.2.3" format="counter"/>,
      and <xref target="RFC3315-18.2.4" format="counter"/>) so that the
      client will
      generate a single transaction when renewing or rebinding its leases.
      However, because some servers may not yet conform to this requirement,
      a client MUST be prepared to select appropriate T1/T2 times as
      described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.3" format="default"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Client-Behavior" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Client Behavior</name>
        <t>A client uses the Solicit message to discover DHCP servers
        configured to assign leases or return other configuration parameters
        on the link to which the client is attached.</t>
        <t>A client uses Request, Renew, Rebind, Release, and Decline messages
        during the normal lifecycle of addresses and delegated prefixes. When
        a client detects that it may have moved to a new link, it uses
        Confirm if it only has addresses and Rebind if it has delegated
        prefixes (and addresses). It uses Information-request messages when it
        needs configuration information but no addresses and no prefixes.</t>
        <t>When a client requests multiple IA option types or multiple
        instances of the same IA types in a Solicit, Request, Renew, or
        Rebind, it is possible
        that the available server(s) may only be configured to offer a subset
        of them. When possible, the client SHOULD use the best configuration
        available and continue to request the additional IAs in subsequent
        messages. This allows the client to maintain
        a single session and state machine. In practice, especially in the
        case of handling IA_NA and IA_PD requests <xref target="RFC7084" format="default"/>,
        this situation should be rare or a result of a temporary operational
        error. Thus, it is more likely that the client will get all
        configuration if it continues, in each subsequent configuration
        exchange, to request all the configuration information it is
        programmed to try to obtain, including any stateful configuration
        options for which no results were returned in previous message
        exchanges.</t>
        <t>Upon receipt of a Reconfigure message from the server, a client
        responds with a Renew, Rebind, or Information-request message as
        indicated by the Reconfigure Message option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.19" format="default"/>).
        The client SHOULD be suspicious of the Reconfigure message (they
        may be faked), and it MUST NOT abandon any resources it might have
        already obtained.
        The client SHOULD treat the Reconfigure message as if the T1 timer
        had expired.  The client will expect the server to send IAs
        and/or other configuration information to the client in a Reply
        message.</t>

          <t>The client sets the "msg-type" field to SOLICIT. The client
          generates a transaction ID and inserts this value in the
          "transaction-id" field.</t>
          <t>The client MUST include a Client Identifier option (see
          <xref target="RFC3315-22.2" format="default"/>) to identify
          itself to the server. The client includes IA options for any IAs to
          which it wants the server to assign leases.</t>
          <t>The client MUST include an Elapsed Time option (see
          <xref target="RFC3315-22.9" format="default"/>) to indicate how long the client has
          been trying to complete the current DHCP message exchange.</t>
          <t>The client uses IA_NA options (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.4" format="default"/>)
          to request the assignment of non-temporary addresses and IA_PD options (see
          <xref target="IA_PD-option" format="default"/>) to request prefix delegation.
          IA_NA or IA_PD options, or a combination, can
          be included in DHCP messages. In addition, multiple instances of any
          IA option type can be included.</t>
          <t>The client MAY include addresses in IA Address options (see
          <xref target="RFC3315-22.6" format="default"/>) encapsulated
          within IA_NA option as hints to the server about the
          addresses for which the client has a preference.</t>
          <t>The client MAY include values in IA Prefix options (see
          <xref target="IAPREFIX-option" format="default"/>)
          encapsulated within IA_PD options as hints for the delegated prefix
          and/or prefix length for which the client has a preference. See
          <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.3" format="default"/> for more on prefix-length hints.</t>
          <t>The client MUST include an Option Request option (ORO) (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.7" format="default"/>) to request the SOL_MAX_RT option (see
          <xref target="SOL_MAX_RT_option" format="default"/>) and any other options the
          client is interested in receiving. The client MAY additionally
          include instances of those options that are identified in the Option
          Request option, with data values as hints to the server about
          parameter values the client would like to have returned.</t>
          <t>The client includes a Reconfigure Accept option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.20" format="default"/>) if the client is willing to accept
          Reconfigure messages from the server.</t>
          <t>The client MUST NOT include any other options in the Solicit
          message, except as specifically allowed in the definition of
          individual options.</t>
          <t>The first Solicit message from the client on the interface SHOULD
          be delayed by a random amount of time between 0 and SOL_MAX_DELAY.
          This random delay helps desynchronize clients that start a DHCP
          session at the same time, such as after recovery from a power
          failure or after a router outage after seeing that DHCP is
          available in Router Advertisement messages (see Section 4.2 of
          <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/>).</t>
          <t>The client transmits the message according to <xref target="RFC3315-14" format="default"/>, using the following parameters: </t>
          <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="11">
            <dt>   IRT</dt>
            <dd>SOL_TIMEOUT</dd>
            <dt>   MRT</dt>
            <dd>SOL_MAX_RT</dd>
            <dt>   MRC</dt>
            <dd>0</dd>
            <dt>   MRD</dt>
            <dd>0</dd>
          </dl>
          <t>A client that wishes to use the Rapid Commit two-message exchange
            includes a Rapid Commit option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.14" format="default"/>)
            in its Solicit message.
            The client may receive a number of different replies from
            different servers.  The client will make note of any valid Advertise
            messages that it receives.  The client will discard any Reply
            messages that do not contain the Rapid Commit option.
          </t>
          <t>Upon receipt of a valid Reply with the Rapid Commit option,
            the client processes the message as described in
            <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.8" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>At the end of the first RT period, if no suitable Reply
            messages are received but the client has valid Advertise
            messages, then the client processes the Advertise as
            described in <xref target="RFC3315-17.1.3" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>If the client subsequently receives a valid Reply message that
          includes a Rapid Commit option, it does one of the following:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>processes the Reply message as described in
              <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.8" format="default"/> and discards any Reply
              messages received in response to the Request message</li>
            <li>processes any Reply messages received in
              response to the Request message and discards the Reply message
              that includes the Rapid Commit option</li>
          </ul>
          <t>If the client is waiting for an Advertise message, the mechanism
          described in <xref target="RFC3315-14" format="default"/> is modified as follows for
          use in the transmission of Solicit messages. The message exchange is
          not terminated by the receipt of an Advertise before the first RT has
          elapsed. Rather, the client collects valid Advertise messages until
          the first RT has elapsed. Also, the first RT MUST be selected to be
          strictly greater than IRT by choosing RAND to be strictly greater
          than 0.</t>
          <t>A client MUST collect valid Advertise messages for the first
          RT seconds, unless it receives a valid Advertise message with a preference
          value of 255. The preference value is carried in the Preference
          option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.8" format="default"/>). Any valid Advertise that
          does not include a Preference option is considered to have a
          preference value of 0. If the client receives a valid Advertise message
          that includes a Preference option with a preference value of 255,
          the client immediately begins a client-initiated message exchange
          (as described in <xref target="request-create-transmit" format="default"/>) by
          sending a Request message to the server from which the Advertise
          message was received. If the client receives a valid Advertise message
          that does not include a Preference option with a preference value of
          255, the client continues to wait until the first RT elapses. If the
          first RT elapses and the client has received a valid Advertise message,
          the client SHOULD continue with a client-initiated message exchange
          by sending a Request message.</t>
          <t>If the client does not receive any valid Advertise messages before the
          first RT has elapsed, it then applies the retransmission mechanism
          described in <xref target="RFC3315-14" format="default"/>. The client
          terminates the retransmission process as soon as it receives any
          valid Advertise message, and the client acts on the received Advertise
          message without waiting for any additional Advertise messages.</t>
          <t>A DHCP client SHOULD choose MRC and MRD values of 0. If the DHCP
          client is configured with either MRC or MRD set to a value other
          than 0, it MUST stop trying to configure the interface if the
          message exchange fails. After the DHCP client stops trying to
          configure the interface, it SHOULD restart the reconfiguration
          process after some external event, such as user input, system
          restart, or when the client is attached to a new link.</t>

            obtained from the server:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>The client uses the addresses, delegated
                prefixes, and other information from any IAs that do not
                contain a Status Code option with the NoAddrsAvail or
                NoPrefixAvail status code. The client MAY include the IAs for
                which it received the NoAddrsAvail or NoPrefixAvail status
                code, with no addresses or prefixes, in subsequent Renew and
                Rebind messages sent to the server, to retry obtaining the
                addresses or prefixes for these IAs.</li>
              <li>The client MUST perform duplicate address
                detection as per Section 5.4 of <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>,
                which does list some exceptions, on each of the
                received addresses in any IAs on which it has not performed
                duplicate address detection during processing of any of the
                previous Reply messages from the server. The client performs
                the duplicate address detection before using the received
                addresses for any traffic. If any of the addresses are found
                to be in use on the link, the client sends a Decline message
                to the server for those addresses as described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.7" format="default"/>.</li>
              <li>For each assigned address that does not have any
                associated reachability information (see the definition of
                "on‑link" in Section 2.1 of
                <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"/>), in order to avoid the
                problems described in <xref target="RFC4943" format="default"/>, the client
                MUST NOT assume that any addresses are reachable on-link as a
                result of receiving an IA Address option (see
                <xref target="RFC3315-22.6" format="default"/>). Addresses obtained from
                an IA Address option MUST NOT be used to form an implicit prefix
                with a length other than 128.</li>
              <li>
                <t>For each delegated prefix, the client assigns a
                subnet to each of the links to which the associated interfaces are
                attached.
                </t>
                <t>
                When a client subnets a delegated prefix, it must assign
                additional bits to the prefix to generate unique, longer prefixes.
                For example, if the client in <xref target="FigISPNetwork" format="default"/> were delegated
                2001:db8:0::/48, it might generate 2001:db8:0:1::/64 and
                2001:db8:0:2::/64 for assignment to the two links in the subscriber
                network.  If the client were delegated 2001:db8:0::/48
                and 2001:db8:5::/48, it might assign 2001:db8:0:1::/64 and
                2001:db8:5:1::/64 to one of the links, and 2001:db8:0:2::/64 and
                2001:db8:5:2::/64 for assignment to the other link.
                </t>
                <t>
                If the client uses a delegated prefix to configure addresses on
                interfaces on itself or other nodes behind it, the preferred and
                valid lifetimes of those addresses MUST be no longer than the
                remaining preferred and valid lifetimes, respectively, for the
                delegated prefix at any time.  In particular, if the delegated
                prefix or a prefix derived from it is advertised for stateless
                address autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4862" format="default"/>, the
                advertised preferred and valid lifetimes MUST NOT exceed the
                corresponding remaining lifetimes of the delegated prefix.</t>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <t>Management of the specific configuration information is
            detailed in the definition of each option in <xref target="RFC3315-22" format="default"/>.</t>
            <t>If the Reply message contains any IAs but the client finds no
            usable addresses and/or delegated prefixes in any of these IAs,
            the client may either try another server (perhaps restarting the
            DHCP server discovery process) or use the Information-request
            message to obtain other configuration information only.</t>
            <t>When the client receives a Reply message in response to a Renew
            or Rebind message, the client:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>Sends a Request message to the server that
                responded if any of the IAs in the Reply message contain the
                NoBinding status code. The client places IA options in this
                message for all IAs. The client continues to use other bindings
                for which the server did not return an error.</li>
              <li>Sends a Renew/Rebind if any of the IAs are not
                in the Reply message, but as this likely indicates that the server
                that responded does not support that IA type, sending immediately
                is unlikely to produce a different result. Therefore, the client
                MUST rate-limit its transmissions (see <xref target="rate-limit" format="default"/>)
                and MAY just wait for the normal retransmission time (as if the
                Reply message had not been received). The client continues to use
                other bindings for which the server did return information.</li>
              <li>Otherwise accepts the information in the

          <t>When a client received a configuration option in an earlier
          Reply and then sends a Renew, Rebind, or Information-request and
          the requested option is not present in the Reply, the client
          SHOULD stop using the previously received configuration
          information.  In other words, the client should behave as if
          it never received this configuration option and return to the
          relevant default state.  If there is no viable way to stop using
          the received configuration information, the values
          received/configured from the option MAY persist if there are
          no other sources for that data and they have no external impact.
          For example, a client that previously received a Client FQDN
          option (see <xref target="RFC4704" format="default"/>) and used
          it to set up its hostname is allowed to continue
          using it if there is no reasonable way for a node to unset its
          hostname and it has no external impact.  As a counter-example,
          a client that previously received an NTP server address from
          the DHCP server and does not receive it anymore MUST stop
          using the configured NTP server address.  The client
          SHOULD be open to other sources of the same configuration
          information.  This behavior does not apply to any IA options,

          <name>Receipt of Reconfigure Messages</name>
          <t>A client receives Reconfigure messages sent to UDP port 546
          on interfaces for which it has acquired configuration information
          through DHCP. These messages may be sent at any time. Since the
          results of a reconfiguration event may affect application-layer
          programs, the client SHOULD log these events and MAY notify these
          programs of the change through an implementation-specific
          interface.</t>
          <t>The message MUST be dropped if it doesn't pass the validation,
          as explained in (see <xref target="RFC3315-15.11" format="default"/>),
          in particular in case the authentication is missing or fails.</t>
          <t>Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure message, the client responds
          with a Renew message, a Rebind message, or an
          Information-request message as indicated by the Reconfigure Message
          option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.19" format="default"/>). The
          client ignores the "transaction‑id" field in the received Reconfigure
          message. While the transaction is in progress, the client discards
          any Reconfigure messages it receives.</t>
          <t>The Reconfigure message acts as a trigger that signals the
          client to complete a successful message exchange. Once the
          client has received a Reconfigure, the client proceeds with the
          message exchange (retransmitting the Renew, Rebind, or
          Information-request message if necessary); the client MUST ignore
          any additional Reconfigure messages until the exchange is
          complete.</t>
          <t>Duplicate messages will be
          ignored because the client will begin the exchange after the
          receipt of the first Reconfigure. Retransmitted messages will
          either (1) trigger the exchange (if the first Reconfigure was
          not received by the client) or (2) be ignored. The server MAY
          discontinue retransmission of Reconfigure messages to the client
          once the server receives the Renew, Rebind, or
          Information‑request message from the client.</t>
          <t>It might be possible for a duplicate or retransmitted
          Reconfigure to be sufficiently delayed (and delivered out of
          order) that it arrives at the client after the exchange (initiated by
          the original Reconfigure) has been completed. In this case, the
          client would initiate a redundant exchange. The likelihood of
          delayed and out‑of‑order delivery is small enough to be
          ignored. The consequence of the redundant exchange is
          inefficiency rather than incorrect operation.</t>

          <name>Refreshing Configuration Information</name>
          <t>Whenever a client may have moved to a new link, the
          prefixes⁠/addresses assigned to the interfaces on that link may no
          longer be appropriate for the link to which the client is attached.
          Examples of times when a client may have moved to a new link
          include the following:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>The client reboots (and has stable storage and
              persistent DHCP state).</li>
            <li>The client is reconnected to a link on which
              it has obtained leases.</li>
            <li>The client returns from sleep mode.</li>
            <li>The client changes access points (e.g., if
              using Wi-Fi technology).</li>
            <li>The client's network interface indicates a disconnection event,
            followed by a connection event.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>Specific algorithms for detecting network attachment changes are out of scope
          for this document. Two possible mechanisms for detecting situations where refreshing
          configuration information may be needed are defined in <xref target="RFC6059"
          format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC4957" format="default" />.</t>
          <t>When the client detects that it may have moved to a new link and it
          has obtained addresses and no delegated prefixes from a server, the
          client SHOULD initiate a Confirm/Reply message exchange. The client
          MUST include any IAs assigned to the interface that may have moved to a
          new link, along with the addresses associated with those IAs, in its
          Confirm message. Any responding servers will indicate whether those
          addresses are appropriate for the link to which the client is
          attached with the status in the Reply message it returns to the
          client.</t>
          <t>If the client has any valid delegated prefixes obtained from the
          DHCP server, the client MUST
          initiate a Rebind/Reply message exchange as described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.4" format="default"/>, with the exception that the
          retransmission parameters should be set as for the Confirm message
          (see <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.2" format="default"/>). The client includes IA_NAs and IA_PDs,
          along with the associated leases, in its Rebind message.</t>
          <t>If the client has only obtained network information using Information-request/Reply
          message exchanges, the client MUST initiate an Information-request/Reply message exchange as
          described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.5" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>
            If not associated with a detection of having moved to a new link, a
            client SHOULD initiate one of the Renew/Reply, Confirm/Reply or
            Information-request/Reply exchanges, if the client detects a
            significant change regarding the prefixes available on the link.
            A change is considered significant when one or more on-link
            prefixes are added, and/or one or more existing on-link prefixes
            are deprecated.
            The reason for this is that such a significant change may indicate
            a configuration change at the server.
            However, a client MUST rate‑limit such initiation attempts to avoid
            flooding a server with requests when there are link issues (for
            example, only doing one of these at most every 30 seconds).
          </t>
          <t>
            The above selection of an exchange to initiate depends on the client's current state:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>If the client has any valid delegated prefixes obtained
            from the server, it sends Renew (as if the T1 time expired) as
            described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.3" />.</li>
            <li>Else, if the client obtained address(es) from the server,
            it sends Confirm as described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.2" />.</li>
            <li>Else, if only network information was obtained from the
            server, it sends Information-request as described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.5" /></li>

        <t>For this discussion, the server is assumed to have been configured
        in an implementation-specific manner with configurations of interest to
        clients.</t>
        <t>A server sends an Advertise message in response to each valid Solicit
        message it receives to announce the availability of the server to the
        client.</t>
        <t>In most cases, the server will send a Reply in response to
        Request, Confirm, Renew, Rebind, Decline, Release, and Information-request
        messages sent by a client. The server will also send a Reply in
        response to a Solicit with a Rapid Commit option
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.14" format="default"/>) when the server is
        configured to respond with committed lease assignments.</t>
        <t>These Advertise and Reply messages MUST always contain the
        Server Identifier option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.3" format="default"/>) containing
        the server's DUID and the Client Identifier option
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.2" format="default"/>) from the
        client message if one was present.</t>
        <t>In most response messages, the server includes options containing
        configuration information for the client. The server must be aware of
        the recommendations on message sizes and the use of fragmentation
        as discussed in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8200" format="default"/>. If the
        client included an Option Request option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.7" format="default"/>) in its message, the server includes options
        in the response message containing configuration parameters for all of
        the options identified in the Option Request option that the server has
        been configured to return to the client. The server MAY return
        additional options to the client if it has been configured to do
        so.</t>
        <t>Any message sent from a client may arrive at the server
        encapsulated in one or more Relay-forward messages. The server MUST
        use the received message to construct the proper Relay-reply
        message to allow the response to the received message to be
        relayed through the same relay agents (in reverse order) as
        the original client message; see <xref target="RFC3315-20.3" format="default"/>
        for more details.
        The server may also need to record this information with each
        client in case it is needed to send a Reconfigure message at a later
        time, unless the server has been configured with addresses that can be
        used to send Reconfigure messages directly to the client (see
        <xref target="reconfigure-transmission" format="default"/>). Note that servers
        that support leasequery <xref target="RFC5007" format="default"/> also need
        to record this information.</t>
        <t>By sending Reconfigure messages, the server MAY initiate a
        configuration exchange to cause DHCP clients to obtain new addresses,
        prefixes, and other configuration information. For example, an
        administrator may use a server-initiated configuration exchange when
        links in the DHCP domain are to be renumbered or when other
        configuration options are updated, perhaps because servers
        are moved, added, or removed.</t>
        <t>When a client receives a Reconfigure message from the server, the
        client initiates sending a Renew, Rebind, or Information-request message
        as indicated by msg-type in the Reconfigure Message option (see
        <xref target="RFC3315-22.19" format="default"/>). The server sends IAs and/or
        other configuration information to the client in a Reply message. The
        server MAY include options containing the IAs and new values for other
        configuration parameters in the Reply message, even if those IAs and
        parameters were not requested in the client's message.</t>

          <t>The server determines the information about the client and its
          location as described in <xref target="RFC3315-11" format="default"/> and
          checks its administrative policy about responding to the client. If
          the server is not permitted to respond to the client, the server
          discards the Solicit message. For example, if the administrative
          policy for the server is that it may only respond to a client that
          is willing to accept a Reconfigure message, if the client does not
          include a Reconfigure Accept option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.20" format="default"/>) in the Solicit message, the server

          message as described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.2.8" format="default"/>.
          The server MUST commit the assignment
          of any addresses and delegated prefixes or other configuration
          information before sending a Reply message to a client. In this case,

          <t>For each IA_NA option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.4" format="default"/>) in the Request

          with the value NotOnLink. If the server

          addresses to an IA, the server MUST return the IA option in the Reply
          message with no addresses in the IA and a Status Code option

          <t>The server MAY assign different addresses and/or delegated prefixes

          <t>For all IAs to which the server can assign addresses or delegated

          and records the IA as a new client binding. The server MUST NOT
          include any addresses or delegated prefixes in the IA that the
          server does not assign to the client.</t>
          <t>The T1/T2 times set in each applicable IA option for a Reply MUST
          be the same values across all IAs. The server MUST determine the

          Currently, sending this option in a Reply is technically redundant,
          as the use of the reconfiguration mechanism requires authentication;
          at present, the only defined mechanism is RKAP (see <xref target="reconfigure-protocol" format="default"/>), and the presence of the

          in the future that would cause RKAP to not be used anymore.</t>
          <t>The server includes other options containing configuration
          information to be returned to the client as described in <xref target="RFC3315-18.2" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>If the server finds that the client has included an IA in the
          Request message for which the server already has a binding that
          associates the IA with the client, the server sends a Reply
          message with existing bindings, possibly with updated lifetimes. The
          server may update the bindings according to its local policies, but
          the server SHOULD generate the response again and not simply
          retransmit previously sent information, even if the
          "transaction‑id" field value matches a previous transmission.
          The server MUST NOT cache its responses.</t>
          <t>DISCUSSION:</t>
          <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
            <li>Cached replies are bad because
          lifetimes need to be updated (either decrease the timers by
          the amount of time elapsed since the original transmission
          or keep the lifetime values and update the lease
          information in the server's database). Also, if the message uses any
          security protection (such as the Replay Detection Method (RDM),
          as described in <xref target="replay" format="default"/>), its value must be updated.
          Additionally, any digests must be updated. Given all of the above,
          caching replies is far more complex than simply sending the
          same buffer as before, and it is easy to miss some of those

          <t>Because of the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against

          <t>The server MUST include a Reconfigure Message option (see

          DHCP client. If the server does not have an address to which it can
          send the Reconfigure message directly to the client, the server
          uses a Relay-reply message (as described in <xref target="RFC3315-20.3" format="default"/>) to send the Reconfigure message to a
          relay agent that will relay the message to the client. The server

          agent, if required) through the information the server has about
          clients that have been in contact with the server (see
          <xref target="RFC3315-18.2" format="default"/>) or through some external agent.</t>
          <t>To reconfigure more than one client, the server unicasts a
          separate message to each client. The server may initiate the
          reconfiguration of multiple clients concurrently; for example, a
          server may send a Reconfigure message to additional clients while
          previous reconfiguration message exchanges are still in

          <t>The Reconfigure message causes the client to initiate a
          Renew/Reply, Rebind/Reply, or Information-request/Reply message
          exchange with the server. The server interprets the receipt of a

          not receive a Renew, Rebind, or Information-request message from
          the client before the RT elapses, the server retransmits the
          Reconfigure message, doubles the RT value, and waits again.
          The server continues this process until REC_MAX_RC unsuccessful
          attempts have been made, at which point the server SHOULD abort

          <t>A relay agent forwards messages containing prefix delegation
          options in the same way as it would relay addresses (i.e., per
          Sections <xref target="relaying-from-client" format="counter"/>
          and <xref target="relaying-from-relay-agent" format="counter"/>).</t>
          <t>If a server communicates with a client through a relay agent
          about delegated prefixes, the server may need a protocol or
          other out‑of‑band communication to configure routing
          information for delegated prefixes on any router through which the
          client may forward traffic.</t>

        <name>Relaying a Relay-reply Message</name>
        <t>The relay agent processes any options included in the Relay-reply
        message in addition to the Relay Message option
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.10" format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>The relay agent extracts the message from the Relay Message option
        and relays it to the address contained in the peer-address field of
        the Relay-reply message. Relay agents MUST NOT modify the message.</t>
        <t>If the Relay-reply message includes an Interface-Id option
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.18" format="default"/>), the
        relay agent relays the message from the server to the client on the
        link identified by the Interface-Id option. Otherwise, if the
        link-address field is not set to 0, the relay agent relays the
        message on the link identified by the link-address field.</t>
        <t>If the relay agent receives a Relay-reply message, it MUST process
        the message as defined above, regardless of the type of message
        encapsulated in the Relay Message option.</t>

      <section anchor="RFC3315-20.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Construction of Relay-reply Messages</name>
        <t>A server uses a Relay-reply message to (1) return a response to a
        client if the original message from the client was relayed to the
        server in a Relay-forward message or (2) send a Reconfigure message
        to a client if the server does not have an address it can use to
        send the message directly to the client.</t>
        <t>A response to the client MUST be relayed through the same relay
        agents as the original client message. The server causes this to
        happen by creating a Relay-reply message that includes a Relay Message
        option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.10" format="default"/>)
        containing the message for the next relay agent in the return
        path to the client. The contained Relay-reply message contains another
        Relay Message option to be sent to the next relay agent, and so on.
        The server must record the contents of the peer-address fields in the
        received message so it can construct the appropriate Relay-reply
        message carrying the response from the server.</t>
        <t>For example, if client C sent a message that was relayed by relay
        agent A to relay agent B and then to the server, the server would send
        the following Relay-reply message to relay agent B:</t>

        </figure>
        <t>When sending a Reconfigure message to a client through a relay
        agent, the server creates a Relay-reply message that includes a Relay
        Message option containing the Reconfigure message for the next relay
        agent in the return path to the client. The server sets the
        peer‑address field in the Relay-reply message header to the
        address of the client and sets the link-address field as required by
        the relay agent to relay the Reconfigure message to the client. The
        server obtains the addresses of the client and the relay agent through
        prior interaction with the client or through some external
        mechanism.</t>

      <section anchor="relay-srv-interaction" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Interaction between Relay Agents and Servers</name>
        <t>Each time a message is relayed by a relay agent towards a server, a
        new encapsulation level is added around the message. Each relay is
        allowed to insert additional options on the encapsulation level it
        added but MUST NOT change anything in the message being encapsulated. If
        there are multiple relays between a client and a server, multiple
        encapsulations are used. Although it makes message processing slightly
        more complex, it provides the major advantage of having a clear
        indication as to which relay inserted which option. The response
        message is expected to travel through the same relays, but in
        reverse order. Each time a response message is relayed back towards a
        client, one encapsulation level is removed.</t>
        <t>In certain cases, relays can add one or more options. These options
        can be added for several reasons:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li> First, relays can provide additional information about the
        client. That source of information is usually more trusted by a
        server administrator, as it comes from the network infrastructure
        rather than the client and cannot be easily spoofed. These options
        can be used by the server to determine its allocation policy.</li>
          <li>Second, a relay may need some information to send a response back to
        the client. Relay agents are expected to be stateless (not retain any
        state after a message has been processed). A relay agent may include
        the Interface-Id option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.18" format="default"/>), which
        will be echoed back in the response. It can include other options and
        ask the server to echo one or more of the options back in the response.
        These options can then be used by the relay agent to send the response
        back to the client, or for other needs. The client will never see
        these options. See <xref target="RFC4994" format="default"/> for details.</li>
          <li>Third, sometimes a relay is the best device to provide values for
        certain options. A relay can insert an option into the message being
        forwarded to the server and ask the server to pass that option back
        to the client. The client will receive that option. It should be noted
        that the server is the ultimate authority here, and -- depending on
        its configuration -- it may or may not send the option back to the
        client. See <xref target="RFC6422" format="default"/> for details.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>For various reasons, servers may need to retain the
        relay information after the message processing is completed.
        One is a bulk leasequery mechanism that may ask for all addresses
        and/or prefixes that were assigned via a specific relay. A second is
        for the reconfigure mechanism. The server may choose to not send the
        Reconfigure message directly to the client but rather to send it via
        relays. This particular behavior is considered an implementation
        detail and is out of scope for this document.</t>

        <name>Summary of DHCP Authentication</name>
        <t>Authentication of DHCP messages is accomplished through the use of
        the Authentication option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.11" format="default"/>).
        The authentication information carried in the Authentication option
        can be used to reliably identify the source of a DHCP message and to
        confirm that the contents of the DHCP message have not been tampered
        with.</t>
        <t>The Authentication option provides a framework for multiple
        authentication protocols. One such protocol, RKAP, is defined in <xref target="reconfigure-protocol" format="default"/>. Other protocols defined in the future
        will be specified in separate documents.</t>
        <t>Any DHCP message MUST NOT include more than one Authentication
        option.</t>
        <t>The protocol field in the Authentication option identifies the
        specific protocol used to generate the authentication information
        carried in the option. The algorithm field identifies a specific
        algorithm within the authentication protocol; for example, the
        algorithm field specifies the hash algorithm used to generate the
        Message Authentication Code (MAC) in the Authentication option. The
        RDM field specifies the type of replay detection used in the
        replay detection field.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="replay" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Replay Detection</name>
        <t>The RDM field of the Authentication option
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.11" format="default"/>) determines the type of
        replay detection used in the replay detection field.</t>
        <t>If the RDM field contains 0x00, the replay detection field MUST be
        set to the value of a strictly monotonically increasing 64-bit unsigned
        integer (modulo 2^64). Using this technique can reduce the danger
        of replay attacks. This method MUST be supported by all Authentication
        option protocols. One choice might be to use the 64-bit NTP timestamp
        format <xref target="RFC5905" format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>A client that receives a message with the RDM field set to 0x00 MUST
        compare its replay detection field with the previous value sent by
        that same server (based on the Server Identifier option; see
        <xref target="RFC3315-22.3" format="default"/>) and only accept the message if the
        received value is greater and record this as the new value. If this
        is the first time a client processes an Authentication option sent by
        a server, the client MUST record the replay detection value and skip
        the replay detection check.</t>
        <t>Servers that support the reconfigure mechanism MUST ensure that
        the replay detection value is retained between restarts. Failing to
        do so may cause clients to refuse Reconfigure messages sent by the
        server, effectively rendering the reconfigure mechanism useless.</t>

        <t>RKAP provides protection against misconfiguration of a client
        caused by a Reconfigure message sent by a malicious DHCP server. In
        this protocol, a DHCP server sends a reconfigure key to the client in
        the initial exchange of DHCP messages. The client records the
        reconfigure key for use in authenticating subsequent Reconfigure
        messages from that server. The server then includes a Hashed Message

        </dl>
        <t>The IA_NA-options field encapsulates those options that are
        specific to this IA_NA. For example, all of the IA Address options
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.6" format="default"/>)
        carrying the addresses associated with this IA_NA are in the
        IA_NA-options field.</t>
        <t>Each IA_NA carries one "set" of non-temporary addresses;
        it is up to the server policy to determine how many addresses are
        assigned, but typically at most one address is assigned from each
        prefix assigned to the link to which the client is attached.</t>
        <t>An IA_NA option may only appear in the options area of a DHCP
        message. A DHCP message may contain multiple IA_NA options (though
        each must have a unique IAID).</t>
        <t>The status of any operations involving this IA_NA is indicated in a
        Status Code option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.13" format="default"/>)
        in the IA_NA-options field.</t>
        <t>Note that an IA_NA has no explicit "lifetime" or "lease length" of
        its own. When the valid lifetimes of all of the addresses in an IA_NA
        have expired, the IA_NA can be considered as having expired. T1 and T2
        are included to give servers explicit control over when a client
        recontacts the server about a specific IA_NA.</t>
        <t>In a message sent by a client to a server, the T1 and T2 fields
        SHOULD be set to 0. The server MUST ignore any values in these fields
        in messages received from a client.</t>
        <t>In a message sent by a server to a client, the client MUST use the
        values in the T1 and T2 fields for the T1 and T2 times, unless
        values in those fields are 0. The values in the T1 and T2 fields
        are the number of seconds until T1 and T2 and are calculated since
        reception of the message.</t>
        <t>As per <xref target="RFC3315-5.6" format="default"/>, the value 0xffffffff is
        taken to mean "infinity" and should be used carefully.</t>
        <t>The server selects the T1 and T2 values to allow the client to
        extend the lifetimes of any addresses in the IA_NA before the
        lifetimes expire, even if the server is unavailable for some short
        period of time. Recommended values for T1 and T2 are 0.5 and 0.8 times
        the shortest preferred lifetime of the addresses in the IA that the
        server is willing to extend, respectively. If the "shortest" preferred
        lifetime is 0xffffffff ("infinity"), the recommended T1 and T2 values
        are also 0xffffffff. If the time at which the addresses in an IA_NA
        are to be renewed is to be left to the discretion of the client, the
        server sets the T1 and T2 values to 0. The client MUST follow the
        rules defined in <xref target="t1-t2-0" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>If a client receives an IA_NA with T1 greater than T2 and both T1
        and T2 are greater than 0, the client discards the IA_NA option and
        processes the remainder of the message as though the server had not
        included the invalid IA_NA option.</t>

        <t>A client MUST include an Elapsed Time option in messages to
        indicate how long the client has been trying to complete a DHCP
        message exchange. The elapsed time is measured from the time at which
        the client sent the first message in the message exchange, and the
        elapsed-time field is set to 0 in the first message in the message
        exchange. Servers and relay agents use the data value in this option
        as input to policy that controls how a server responds to a client
        message. For example, the Elapsed Time option allows a secondary DHCP
        server to respond to a request when a primary server has not answered
        in a reasonable time. The elapsed-time value is a 16-bit
        (2-octet) unsigned integer. The client uses the value 0xffff to
        represent any elapsed-time values greater than the largest time value
        that can be represented in the Elapsed Time option.</t>

        <t>A client MAY include this option in a Solicit message if the client
        is prepared to perform the Solicit/Reply message exchange described in
        <xref target="solicit-create-transmit" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>A server MUST include this option in a Reply message sent in
        response to a Solicit message when completing the Solicit/Reply
        message exchange.</t>
        <t>DISCUSSION:</t>
        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
          <li>Each server that responds with a Reply to a Solicit that
            includes a Rapid Commit option will commit the leases
            in the Reply message to the client but will not receive any
            confirmation that the client has received the Reply message.
            Therefore, if more than one server responds to a Solicit that
            includes a Rapid Commit option, all but one server will commit
            leases that are not actually used by the client; this could
            result in incorrect address information in DNS if the DHCP servers
            update DNS <xref target="RFC4704" format="default"/>, and responses to
            leasequery requests <xref target="RFC5007" format="default"/> may include
            information on leases not in use by the client.</li>
          <li>The problem of unused leases can be minimized by designing
            the DHCP service so that only one server responds to the
            Solicit or by using relatively short lifetimes for newly assigned
            leases.</li>

        (see <xref target="IAPREFIX-option" format="default"/>)
        carrying the prefixes associated with this IA_PD are in the
        IA_PD-options field.</t>
        <t>An IA_PD option may only appear in the options area of a DHCP
        message. A DHCP message may contain multiple IA_PD options (though

        Status Code option (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.13" format="default"/>)
        in the IA_PD-options field.</t>
        <t>Note that an IA_PD has no explicit "lifetime" or "lease length" of
        its own. When the valid lifetimes of all of the prefixes in an IA_PD
        have expired, the IA_PD can be considered as having expired. T1 and T2
        fields are included to give the server explicit control over when a
        client should contact the server about a
        specific IA_PD.</t>
        <t>In a message sent by a client to a server,
        the T1 and T2 fields SHOULD be set to 0. The server MUST
        ignore any values in these fields in messages received from a
        client.</t>
        <t>In a message sent by a server to a client,
        the client MUST use the values in the T1 and T2 fields for
        the T1 and T2 timers, unless values in those fields are 0.
        The values in the T1 and T2 fields are the number of seconds until T1
        and T2.</t>
        <t>The server selects the T1 and T2 times to allow the
        client to extend the lifetimes of any prefixes in the IA_PD
        before the lifetimes expire, even if the server is
        unavailable for some short period of time. Recommended values for T1
        and T2 are 0.5 and 0.8 times the shortest preferred lifetime of the
        prefixes in the IA_PD that the server is willing to extend,
        respectively. If the time at which the prefixes in an IA_PD are to be
        renewed is to be left to the discretion of the client, the
        server sets T1 and T2 to 0. The client MUST
        follow the rules defined in <xref target="t1-t2-0" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>If a client receives an IA_PD with T1 greater than T2
        and both T1 and T2 are greater than 0, the client discards
        the IA_PD option and processes the remainder of the message as though
        the server had not included the IA_PD option.</t>

        <t>A DHCP client MUST request this option in the Option Request option
        (see <xref target="RFC3315-22.7" format="default"/>) when sending Information-request
        messages. A client MUST NOT request this option in the Option Request
        option in any other messages.</t>
        <t>A server sending a Reply to an Information-request message SHOULD
        include this option if it is requested in the Option Request option
        of the Information-request. The option value MUST NOT be smaller
        than IRT_MINIMUM. This option MUST only appear in the top-level
        options area of Reply messages.</t>
        <t>If the Reply to an Information-request message does not contain this
        option, the client MUST behave as if the option with the value
        IRT_DEFAULT was provided.</t>
        <t>A client MUST use the refresh time IRT_MINIMUM if it receives the
        option with a value less than IRT_MINIMUM.</t>
        <t>As per <xref target="RFC3315-5.6" format="default"/>, the value 0xffffffff is taken to
        mean "infinity" and implies that the client should not refresh its
        configuration data without some other trigger (such as detecting
        movement to a new link).</t>
        <t>If a client contacts the server to obtain new data or refresh some
        existing data before the refresh time expires, then it SHOULD also
        refresh all data covered by this option.</t>
        <t>When the client detects that the refresh time has expired, it SHOULD
        try to update its configuration data by sending an
        Information‑request as specified in
        <xref target="RFC3315-18.1.5" format="default"/>, except that the
        client MUST delay sending the first Information-request by a random
        amount of time between 0 and INF_MAX_DELAY.</t>
        <t>A client MAY have a maximum value for the refresh time, where that
        value is used whenever the client receives this option with a value
        higher than the maximum.  This also means that the maximum value is
        used when the received value is "infinity".  A maximum value might
        make the client less vulnerable to attacks based on forged DHCP
        messages.  Without a maximum value, a client may be made to use wrong

      <t>NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please remove this section before publication.
      It is intended for the IESG evaluation.</t>

      <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
     protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
     this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
     RFC 7942.  The description of implementations in this section is
     intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
     progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
     individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
     IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
     information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
     This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
     catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers
     are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>

     <t>According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working
     groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
     benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
     experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
     protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups
     to use this information as they see fit".</t>

      <t>The DHCPv6 protocol was originally published as RFC 3315 in July 2003. Many extensions were defined and RFC
      8415 was published in November 2018. The protocol was implemented by many vendors that claim DHCPv6 compliance.
      It is sometimes difficult to determine whether full compliance with 8415 is claimed.</t>

      <t>The DHCPv6 protocol enjoys multiple interoperable implementations from all sectors of industry.
      There are many open source and proprietary implementations, both general software and hardware-specific.
      The following implementations (listed alphabetically) are known to support DHCPv6:</t>

    compliance is one aspect of the program.</t>

    <t>While the original IPv6 Ready Logo testing involved the original DHCPv6 specifications (primarily RFC3315,
    RFC3633), the large number of tested and certified implementations supports the breadth and depth of DHCPv6
    implementations available and deployed in the marketplace over the years that confirm the protocol specifications are
    up to Internet Standard. See https://www.ipv6ready.org/db/index.php/public/search/?l=&amp;c=&amp;ds=&amp;de=&amp;pc=&amp;ap=2&amp;oem=&amp;etc=D&amp;fw=&amp;vn=&amp;do=1&amp;o=6.- </t>

    <section anchor="security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This section discusses security considerations that are not related
      to privacy. See <xref target="privacy" format="default"/> for a discussion
      dedicated to privacy.</t>

      <t>The threat to DHCP is inherently an insider threat (assuming a
      properly configured network where DHCP ports are blocked on the
      perimeter gateways of the enterprise). Regardless of the gateway
      configuration, however, the potential attacks by insiders and
      outsiders are the same.</t>

      <t>DHCP lacks end-to-end encryption between clients and servers; thus,
      hijacking, tampering, and eavesdropping attacks are all possible
      as a result. Some network environments (discussed below) can be
      secured through various means to minimize these attacks.</t>

      <t>The threat common to both the client and the server is the
      "resource-exhaustion" DoS attack. These attacks typically involve the
      exhaustion of available assigned addresses or delegatable prefixes, or
      the exhaustion of CPU or network bandwidth, and are present any time
      there is a shared resource.  Some forms of these exhaustion attacks
      can be partially mitigated by appropriate server policy, e.g., limiting
      the maximum number of leases any one client can get, limiting the number
      of leases one client can decline, and limiting number of messages a
      single client can transmit of a period of time.</t>

      <section anchor="security-client" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Client Security Considerations</name>

      <t>One attack specific to a DHCP client is the establishment of a
      malicious server with the intent of providing incorrect configuration
      information to the client.  The motivation for doing so may be to mount
      a "man in the middle" attack that causes the client to communicate with
      a malicious server instead of a valid server for some service (such as
      DNS or NTP).  The malicious server may also mount a DoS attack
      through misconfiguration of the client; this attack would cause all
      network communication from the client to fail.</t>
      <t>A malicious DHCP server might cause a client to set its SOL_MAX_RT
      and INF_MAX_RT parameters to an unreasonably high value with the
      SOL_MAX_RT (see <xref target="SOL_MAX_RT_option" format="default"/>) and INF_MAX_RT
      (see <xref target="INF_MAX_RT_option" format="default"/>) options; this may cause
      an undue delay in a client completing its DHCP protocol transaction
      in the case where no other valid response is received.  Assuming that
      the client also receives a response from a valid DHCP server,
      large values for SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT will not have any effect.</t>
      <t>Another threat to DHCP clients originates from mistakenly or
      accidentally configured DHCP servers that answer DHCP client requests
      with unintentionally incorrect configuration parameters.</t>

      <t>If a client implementation supports the reconfigure mechanism, also see
      <xref target="security-rkap"/> below.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="security-server" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Server Security Considerations</name>

      <t>The threat specific to a DHCP server is an invalid client masquerading
      as a valid client.  The motivation for this may be for theft of service,
      or to circumvent auditing for any number of nefarious purposes.</t>

      <t>The messages exchanged between relay agents and servers may be used to
      mount a man-in-the-middle or DoS attack. Communication
      between a server and a relay agent, and communication between relay
      agents, can be authenticated and encrypted through the use of IPsec, as
      described in <xref target="RFC8213" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>However, the use of manually configured pre-shared keys for IPsec
      between relay agents and servers does not defend against replayed DHCP
      messages.  Replayed messages can represent a DoS attack through
      exhaustion of processing resources but not through misconfiguration or
      exhaustion of other resources such as assignable addresses and
      delegatable prefixes.</t>

      <t>If a server implementation supports the reconfigure mechanism, also see
      <xref target="security-rkap"/> below.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="security-rkap" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Reconfigure Security Considerations</name>
      <t>RKAP, described in <xref target="reconfigure-protocol" format="default"/>,
      provides protection against the
      use of a Reconfigure message by a malicious DHCP server to mount a DoS
      or man-in-the-middle attack on a client.  This protocol can be
      compromised by an attacker that can intercept the initial message in
      which the DHCP server sends the key as plain text to the client.</t>

      <t>Because of the opportunity for attack through the Reconfigure message,
      a DHCP client MUST discard any Reconfigure message that does not include
      authentication or that does not pass the validation process for the
      authentication protocol.</t>

      <t>A DHCP client may also be subject to attack through the receipt of a
      Reconfigure message from a malicious server that causes the client to
      obtain incorrect configuration information from that server.  Note that
      although a client sends its response (Renew, Rebind, or
      Information-request message) through a relay agent and, therefore, that
      response will only be received by servers to which DHCP messages are
      relayed, a malicious server could send a Reconfigure message to a client,
      followed (after an appropriate delay) by a Reply message that would be
      accepted by the client.  Thus, a malicious server that is not on the
      network path between the client and the server may still be able to
      mount a Reconfigure attack on a client.  The use of transaction IDs that
      are cryptographically sound and cannot easily be predicted will also
      reduce the probability that such an attack will be successful.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="security-mitigation" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Mitigation Considerations</name>

      <t>Various network environments also offer levels of security if deployed
      as described below.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>In enterprise and factory networks, use of authentication per
      <xref target="IEEE-802.1x" format="default"/> can prevent unknown or untrusted clients
      from connecting to the network. However, this does not necessarily
      assure that the connected client will be a good DHCP or network
      actor.</li>
        <li>For wired networks where clients typically are connected to a switch
      port, snooping DHCP multicast (or unicast) traffic becomes difficult, as
      the switches limit the traffic delivered to a port. The client's DHCP
      multicast messages (with destination address fe02::1:2) are only forwarded
      to the DHCP server's (or relay's) switch port -- not all ports. Also, the
      server's (or relay's) unicast replies are only delivered to the target
      client's port -- not all ports.</li>
        <li>In public networks (such as a Wi-Fi network in a coffee shop or
      airport), it is possible for others within radio range to snoop DHCP and
      other traffic. But in these environments, there is very little if
      anything that can be learned from the DHCP traffic itself (either from
      client to server or from server to client) if the privacy considerations
      provided in <xref target="privacy" format="default"/> are followed. Even for devices that
      do not follow the privacy considerations, there is little that can
      be learned that would not be available from subsequent communications
      anyway (such as the device's Media Access Control (MAC) address). Also,
      because all clients will typically receive similar configuration details,
      a bad actor that initiates a DHCP request itself can learn much of
      such information. As mentioned above, one threat is that the RKAP key
      for a client can be learned (if the initial
      Solicit/Advertise/Request/Reply exchange is monitored) and trigger a
      premature reconfiguration, but this is relatively easily prevented by
      disallowing direct client-to-client communication on these networks or
      using <xref target="RFC7610" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC7513" format="default"/>.</li>
      </ul>

      <t>Many of the attacks by rogue servers can be mitigated by making use
      of the mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC7610" format="default"/>
      and <xref target="RFC7513" format="default"/>.</t>

              <t>This document proposes an informal management model of Differentiated Services (Diffserv) routers for use in their management and configuration.  This model defines functional datapath elements (e.g., classifiers, meters, actions, marking, absolute dropping, counting, multiplexing), algorithmic droppers, queues and schedulers.  It describes possible configuration parameters for these elements and how they might be interconnected to realize the range of traffic conditioning and per-hop behavior (PHB) functionalities described in the Diffserv Architecture.

              <t>A node may have support for communications using IPv4 and/or IPv6 protocols.  Such a node may wish to obtain IPv4 and/or IPv6 configuration settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  The original version of DHCP (RFC 2131) designed for IPv4 has now been complemented by a new DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) for IPv6.  This document describes issues identified with dual IP version DHCP interactions, the most important aspect of which is how to handle potential problems in clients processing configuration information received from both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers.  The document makes a recommendation on the general strategy on how best to handle such issues and identifies future work to be undertaken.

              <t>This document describes the historical and background information behind the removal of the "on-link assumption" from the conceptual host sending algorithm defined in Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6).  According to the algorithm as originally described, when a host's default router list is empty, the host assumes that all destinations are on-link.  This is particularly problematic with IPv6-capable nodes that do not have off-link IPv6 connectivity (e.g., no default router).  This document describes how making this assumption causes problems and how these problems outweigh the benefits of this part of the conceptual sending algorithm.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses.  Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no meaning and that the entire identifier should be treated as an opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies that those two bits are significant only in the process of deriving interface identifiers from an IEEE link-layer address, and it updates RFC 4291 accordingly.</t>

              <t>IPv4 connectivity is still needed as networks migrate towards IPv6.  Users require IPv4 configuration even if the uplink to their service provider supports IPv6 only.  This document describes a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 configuration information dynamically in IPv6 networks by carrying DHCPv4 messages over DHCPv6 transport.  Two new DHCPv6 messages and two new DHCPv6 options are defined for this purpose.</t>

              <t>This text describes evolving networking technology within residential home networks with increasing numbers of devices and a trend towards increased internal routing.  The goal of this document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home networking, describing the associated principles, considerations, and requirements.  The text briefly highlights specific implications of the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.  There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.</t>

              <t>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected to a switched network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  It is based on DHCPv6 packet filtering at the layer 2 device at which the packets are received.  A similar mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4 networks ('DHCP snooping'); hence, it is desirable that similar functionality be provided for IPv6 networks.  This document specifies a Best Current Practice for the implementation of DHCPv6-Shield.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart.  An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or fewer unique addresses.  As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort to perform address-scanning attacks against IPv6 networks; therefore, IPv6 address-scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible.  This document formally obsoletes RFC 5157, which first discussed this assumption, by providing further analysis on how traditional address-scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks and exploring some additional techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.</t>

The aforementioned method results in stable addresses within each subnet, even in the presence of multiple DHCPv6 servers or DHCPv6 server reinstallments.  It is a DHCPv6 variant of the method specified in RFC 7217 for IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.</t>

Changing addresses over time limits the window of time during which eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity correlation when the same address is employed for multiple transactions by the same host.  Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication.  This document obsoletes RFC 4941.</t>

      <name>Summary of Changes</name>
      <t>This appendix provides a summary of the changes made from
      RFC8415:

      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>The following mechanisms were obsoleted. These were not widely
deployed while adding complexity to client and server implementations.
Legacy implementations MAY support them, but implementations conformant
to this document MUST NOT rely on them. Obsoleting these features does
not cause any interoperatability issues when mixing updated and non-updated
clients, relay agents, and servers as these mechanisms were "optional".

          </t>
          <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
            <dt>IA_TA option.</dt>
            <dd>
      The Identity Association for Temporary Addresses option has
      been obsoleted. A client that needs a short-term / special
      purpose address can use a new IA_NA binding to request an
      address and release it when finished with it.</dd>
            <dt>UNICAST option.</dt>
            <dd>
      The Server Unicast option has been obsoleted. Use of this
      was rarely practical as typically relay agents between the
      client and server need to glean information from the
      communication and cannot be bypassed.</dd>
            <dt>UseMulticast status code.</dt>
            <dd>
      The UseMulticast status code has been obsoleted. Clients
      will always multicast messages (as Server Unicast option
      has been obsoleted) and servers will no longer check for
      unicast traffic.</dd>
          </dl>
        </li>
        <li>The following errata for RFC 8415 were incorporated:
erratum IDs 6159, 6269 and 6183.
Note that erratum ID 6269 was no longer
applicable after the Server Unicast Option was obsoleted.
Note that erratum 6159 is also no longer applicable now that temporary
addresses have been obsoleted.  Indeed, the section (6.5) that erratum
6159 corrects has been deleted.
</li>
        <li>A reference to RFC 7943 was added to <xref target="addr-assign-ia-na" format="default"/> as
it documents a method that might be used to generate addresses and was
inadvertently missed when compiling RFC 8415.
</li>
        <li>Clarified the UDP ports used by clients, servers, and
        relay agents (<xref target="udp-ports" format="default"/>).</li>
        <li>Several additional RFCs have been referenced and editorial
        and reviews comments incorporated.</li>
