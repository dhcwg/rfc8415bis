I suppose the server could use it for every REPLY (except when responding to REBIND). No sure what were the exact reasons, but I can speculate. Perhaps because it wouldn't work for REBIND? Or many clients not supporting it at all and doing fine? So how effective would it be - \"some clients that support it get the transactions protected some of the time\". That doesn't sound very reassuring.\n\nRKAP is not great. When supported, the message sent in the initial exchange sends Rekonfigure key in plain text. No Diffie-Hellman or anything similar. Plain text over wire. So there's a window of opportunity, where sniffing attack is very easy. We tried to solve this (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6/), but we gave up after -21 and getting conflicting directions from different IESG members.\n\nI'll add a note when addressing #44.",

The Advertise or Reply\n  message MUST be unicast through the interface on which the original\n  message was received.\n\nThis may be pedantic, but I think limiting the outgoing interface is too strict.

I don\u2019t think this is appropriate here as this a background section which discussed IPv6 concepts. I think deleting this is best. We already have text in section 6.3 which provides multiple references to this RFC, so I don\u2019t think we need more text? If you want some, maybe adding the following in 6.4 to replace the first sentence is one choice: \u201cThe DHCP requirements and network architecture for Customer Edge Routers are described in [RFC7084], with improvements for renumbering described in [RFC9096].\u201d\n\nBTW: There\u2019s a further reference to 9096 in 5.3 related to Reconfigure. So likely we have this covered very well, even without adding the above to 6.4?\n\nIn 6.2, we had:\n\n   The model of operation for non-temporary address assignment is as\n   follows.  The server\u2026\n\nThis was changed to:\n\n   The model of operation for non-temporary address assignment is as\n   follows: The server\u2026\n\nBut in 6.3, a similar change was not made \u2026 we should be consistent.\n\nHowever, I also think the change isn\u2019t really good as the next sentence doesn\u2019t describe the full model \u2026 it is in really the remaining sentences. To fix this, it might be good to add an enumerated list which is each of the sentences that follows \u201cfollows:\u201d.\n\nPlease take a look and let\u2019s discuss best fix.\n\nIn Section 6.2, reference to 12.1 was added for lifetimes, similar change was not made (reference to 12.2) in section 6.3. Should be done - Each prefix has an associated\u2026 (see Section 12.2).\n\nIn Section 6.5, a reference to 7934 was added and I think it is in a bad place.\n\n   A client can explicitly request multiple addresses by sending\n   multiple IA_NA options.  A client can send multiple IA_NA options in\n   its initial transmissions ([RFC7934]).  Alternatively, it can send an\n   extra Request message with additional new IA_NA options (or include\n   them in a Renew message).\n\nHow about:\n\n   To meet the recommendations of [RFC7934] for multiple addresses,\n   a client can explicitly request multiple addresses by sending\n   multiple IA_NA options.  A client can send multiple IA_NA options in\n   its initial transmissions.  Alternatively, it can send an extra\n   Request message with additional new IA_NA options (or include them in\n   a Renew message).\n\nIn new 6.6 section, \u201cThe [RFC9686]\u201d is odd. Remove the? And I still hate that there is text about updating DNS, routing tables\u2026 none of this is mentioned in that document. We MUST remove this!!! \n\nI think we just say \u201cso that the server can log or record these addresses\u201d. Please!!\n\nIn section 5.1 and 18 we basically have similar text:\n\n   A DHCP client that does not need to have a DHCP server assign IP\n   addresses or delegated prefixes to it can obtain configuration\n   information such as a list of available DNS servers [RFC3646] or NTP\n   servers [RFC5908] through a single message and reply exchange with a\n   DHCP server.  To obtain \n\nIn 18,  \u201c(As originally described in [RFC3736]).\u201d was added. Perhaps thus should be in 5.1 (too)? And wouldn\u2019t it be better not to have this be a standalone sentence but part of the first (as originally described\u2026).\n\nIn 18.2.6, something went bad with edit? First paragraph:\n\n   The client uses an Information-request message to obtain\n   configuration information without having addresses and/or delegated\n   prefixes assigned to it without using DHCPv6 to request addreses or\n   prefixes.\n\nHuh? I\u2019m not even sure what intent of this change was. Original sentence seemed clear?\n\nIn new 23.1 section, last paragraph, add the and lowercase R in Reconfigure: \u201c\u2026support the reconfigure mechanism\u201d (3 other places use lowercase). Similar fix in 23.2, last paragraph.\n\nFinally, we haven\u2019t kept up Appendix A with summary of changes. Perhaps we want to add a catch-all \u2026 \u201c5. Several additional RFCs have been referenced and editorial changes from various reviews have been incorporated.\u201d?\n",

      "body": "These set of comments are about removing references to RFCs incorporated and obsoleted by 8415 and removing background material. Line numbers reference -09 draft.\n\n274\t1.1.  Relationship to Previous DHCPv6 Standards\n\n276\t   The initial specification of DHCPv6 was defined in [[RFC3315](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3315/)], and a\n277\t   number of follow-up documents were published over the years:\n\n<major> I see that this document is trying to carry forward history prior\nto [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/) about DHCPv6 specifications. I find this concerning since it asks\nthe reader to go back to those old and obsoleted documents when reading this\nbrand new RFC. My concern is that it has the potential to at worst confuse and\nat best waste time of someone trying to implement DHCPv6 afresh. Especially, \ngiven that this is moving to Internet Standard, I would like to discuss if\nthere are any problems in removing all references to the obsoleted documents\nother than [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/) itself.\n\nThe reader could be pointed to [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/) section 1.1 for history (just as done \nfor IA_TA).\n\n\n311\t1.2.  Relationship to DHCPv4\n\n313\t   The operational models and relevant configuration information for\n314\t   DHCPv4 [[RFC2131](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2131/)] [[RFC2132](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2132/)] and DHCPv6 are sufficiently different that\n315\t   integration between the two services is not included in this\n316\t   document.  [[RFC3315](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3315/)] suggested that future work might be to extend\n317\t   DHCPv6 to carry IPv4 address and configuration information.  However,\n318\t   the current consensus of the IETF is that DHCPv4 should be used\n319\t   rather than DHCPv6 when conveying IPv4 configuration information to\n\n<major> The above text may be harmful to new implementations of DHCPv6. If the\nWG has taken the decision to not use it for IPv4, then isn't now the\ntime to clarify this aspect before this moves to Internet Standard? If I were\nimplementing DHCPv6 currently, would I design and write code expecting that at\nsome point, my implementation would need to support IPv4 as well? Or, can\nthe spec provide definitive clarity to implementors on such aspects and not\ncarry forward these uncertainties?\n\n\n793\t6.1.  Stateless DHCP\n\n795\t   Stateless DHCP [[RFC3736](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3736/)] can be used at any time, typically when a\n796\t   node requires some missing or expired configuration information that\n797\t   is available via DHCP.\n\n<major> [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/) obsoleted [RFC3736](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3736/). This document obsoletes [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/). Why do we \nstill need to reference [RFC3736](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3736/) for this term. Perhaps we should have a forward \nreference to section 6.1 of this document instead? Please see similar comments\nfor a few other references to obsoleted RFCs.\n\n\n836\t6.3.  DHCP for Prefix Delegation\n\n838\t   The prefix delegation mechanism, originally described in [[RFC3633](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3633/)],\n\n<major> Isn't the reference to [RFC3633](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3633/) that has been obsoleted to the 2nd\ndegree avoidable?\n\n\n1009\t7.1.  Multicast Addresses\n\n1011\t   [[RFC3315](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3315/)] registered the following multicast addresses, and this\n1012\t   specification is now authoritative for:\n\n<major> The reference to [RFC3315](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3315/) is outdated and incorrect. The IANA registry\npoints to [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/). What does it mean \"now authoritative for\"? That was perhaps\nappropriate for [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/), but seems very odd for this document.\n\n\n2316\t18.1.  A Single Exchange for Multiple IA Options\n\n2318\t   This document assumes that a client SHOULD use a single transaction\n2319\t   for all of the IA options required on an interface; this simplifies\n2320\t   the client implementation and reduces the potential number of\n2321\t   transactions required (for the background on this design choice,\n2322\t   refer to Section 4 of [[RFC7550](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7550/)]).  To facilitate a client's use of a\n\n<major> Isn't the reference to [RFC7550](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7550/) that has been obsoleted to the 2nd\ndegree avoidable?\n\n\n3933\t19.1.  Relaying a Client Message or a Relay-forward Message\n\n3935\t   A relay agent relays both messages from clients and Relay-forward\n3936\t   messages from other relay agents.  When a relay agent receives a\n3937\t   Relay-forward message, a recognized message type for which it is not\n3938\t   the intended target, or an unrecognized message type [[RFC7283](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7283/)], it\n\n<major> Isn't the reference to [RFC7283](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7283/) that has been obsoleted to the 2nd\ndegree avoidable?\n\n\n4790\t21.11.  Authentication Option\n\n4792\t   The Authentication option carries authentication information to\n4793\t   authenticate the identity and contents of DHCP messages.  The use of\n4794\t   the Authentication option is described in Section 20.  The delayed\n4795\t   authentication protocol, defined in [[RFC3315](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3315/)], was obsoleted by\n4796\t   [[RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/)].  The format of the Authentication option is:\n\n<major> If this is something that was already obsoleted by [RFC8415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8415/), why is it\neven present in this document",

We could do interactive rebase to rewrite history. We could keep renaming a single file to match whatever filename the next commit wanted to update. At the end, we would have a single file with the changes applied by appropriate authors. It's a bit more work. I can do an experiment some time next week if you feel it's useful.",

Esko on Nov. 11 he proposed to update 5 items, but once someone (Tim, I think) explained the scope of bis work, he asked:\r\n\r\n> If we change text to clarify something, without proposing new functionality, would that still fit in the 8415bis scope or cleaning up, or not?\r\n\r\nbut he got no answer. In my opinion the list in 18.2.12 is non-normative. I treat it as a non-exhaustive list of examples, so I'm fine if they want to add couple more. He also proposed to donate a text for \"significant change\", I'd love to get it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

The reason for this is that such a significant change may indicate a configuration change at the server. However, a client MUST rate\u2011limit such exchange attempts to avoid flooding a server with requests when there are link issues (for example, only doing one of these at most every 30 seconds).\r\n\r\nThe above selection of an exchange to initiate depends on the client's current state:\r\n1. If the client has any valid delegated prefixes obtained from the server, it sends Renew (as if the T1 time expired) as described in Section 18.2.4.\r\n2. Else, if the client obtained address(es) from the server, it sends Confirm as described in Section 18.2.3.\r\n3. Else, if only network information was obtained from the server, it sends Information-request as described in Section 18.2.6.\r\n\r\n",

The server policy, such as \r\nwhat options assign to which clients, which subnets or pools of resources to use,\r\nwhich clients' requests should be denied etc. are out of scope for this document.\r\n\r\nServer configuration, operation and management are also out of scope. One\r\npossible way to manage a DHCPv6 server is proposed in RFC9243.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo opinion about RFC9663, although I feel it doesn't hurt to add yet another informative reference. This RFC will be a one stop for all DHCPv6-related stuff.",
