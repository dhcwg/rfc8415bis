Well, 99% of the XML issues go away if you'd let us use kramdown as I originally proposed.

Esko on Nov. 11 he proposed to update 5 items, but once someone (Tim, I think) explained the scope of bis work, he asked:\r\n\r\n> If we change text to clarify something, without proposing new functionality, would that still fit in the 8415bis scope or cleaning up, or not?\r\n\r\nbut he got no answer. In my opinion the list in 18.2.12 is non-normative. I treat it as a non-exhaustive list of examples, so I'm fine if they want to add couple more.

However, a client MUST rate\u2011limit such attempts to avoid flooding a server with requests when there are link issues (for example, only doing one of these at most every 30 seconds).\r\n\r\nNEW:\r\n\r\nIf not associated with a detection of having moved to a new link, a client SHOULD initiate one of the Renew/Reply, Confirm/Reply or Information-request/Reply exchanges, if the client detects a significant change regarding the prefixes available on the link. A change is considered significant when one or more on-link prefixes are added, and/or one or more existing on-link prefixes are deprecated. The reason for this is that such a significant change may indicate a configuration change at the server. However, a client MUST rate\u2011limit such exchange attempts to avoid flooding a server with requests when there are link issues (for example, only doing one of these at most every 30 seconds).\r\n\r\nThe above selection of an exchange to initiate depends on the client's current state:\r\n1. If the client has any valid delegated prefixes obtained from the server, it sends Renew (as if the T1 time expired) as described in Section 18.2.4.\r\n2. Else, if the client obtained address(es) from the server, it sends Confirm as described in Section 18.2.3.\r\n3. Else, if only network information was obtained from the server, it sends Information-request as described in Section 18.2.6.\r\n\r\n",
